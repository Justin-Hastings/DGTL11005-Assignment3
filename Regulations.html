          <p>
            Like all sports and activities, there are specific rules for fishing and these must
            be adhered to whilst following all other state laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key example of these rules is not being able to fish in specified areas, usually
            private marinas and other privately owned wharfs. It is also advisable to not enter
            private property for fishing unless permission has been given as this is also classified as trespass.
          </p>
          <p>
            All marine rules must also be followed when using a boat, especially speed and proximity regulations.

          <!-- Size and bag limits -->
          <h2 class="title">Size and Bag Limits</h2>
          <p>
            Size and bag limits exist to ensure fish will still be around for future generations by allowing fish
            to breed and by stopping individuals from clearing out whole schools of fish in one go. These limits
            are designed to help fishing continue at a high level, so breaking these rules will impact the future
            of fishing. There are also regulations for crabbing.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are caught not complying with these regulations, you will face penalties, including hefty fines
            and possibly even jail time.

          <h2 class="title">Identifying Fish</h2>
          <p>
            Identifying fish can be difficult especially for species that look similar. A fish identification book or app
            <a class="orange-A-Tags" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.gov.qld.daff.Fisheries&hl=en_AU">(which can be downloaded from here)</a>
            is a great tool for resolving this issue. The books are available at most local tackle stores or one can
            be purchased from <a class="orange-A-Tags" href="https://afn.com.au/product/australian-fish-id-pocket-guide/">here</a>.

          <h2 class="centred-title title">Measuring Fish</h2>
          <p>
            Measuring fish is an easy way to avoid keeping undersized fish. For measuring fish, a brag mat or
            measuring board are better than a tape measure. Fish can be categorised as having a forked tail or
            a flat tail and they are measured differently. To accurately measure a fish, follow these steps and
            then do step 3 for the required tail type:

          <p>
            Zoning rules protect areas with an environmental risk and to control the numbers of some species. Most
            landbased spots aren’t impacted by marine zonings, however, it’s a good idea to check where you are going
            before leaving to ensure you are allowed to fish there because not knowing the zones isn't an excuse for
            breaking the law. Some zones don’t allow fishing at all, like green zones and some just limit fishing, like yellow zones.
          </p>
          <p>
            To check the zones, you could download the <a class="orange-A-Tags" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thinkspatial.eyeonthereef&hl=en_AU">
