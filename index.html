          <h1 class="title">What is Recreational Fishing?</h1>
          <p>
            Recreational fishing is a common hobby, practiced by numerous people. Fishing is about
            relaxing and having fun in the great outdoors, whether it be by yourself or with mates!
            And the best part about this hobby, is that you don’t need the most expensive gear to enjoy
            yourself.
            <br>
            Fishing can take you to pristine locations and is also great for stress relief and mental health in general.

          <h2 class="title">Crocodiles</h2>
          <p>
            Crocodiles reside in most waterways in the northern parts of Australia. Saltwater crocs are known to attack
            humans and are more than capable of killing them. It is for this reason that you should be careful when
            around waterways in these areas.
            <br>
            Most water related facilities have a warning sign, however common sense should prevail.

          <h2 class="title">Be Crocwise in Croc Country!</h2>
          <p>
            Don’t be fooled by the name saltwater, as they can live in the freshwater as well. It is for this reason
            that it pays to be careful around all waterways in these areas, whether you are fishing or not. It’s a good
            idea to never have your back to the water when near the bank.
            <br>
            As you can see in the image, crocodiles are masters at camouflaging themselves in the water, so just because you can't
            see them, DOES NOT mean they are not there.

            The weather plays an important role in fishing. Bad conditions can be

            However, this worst-case scenario can generally be avoided by checking the weather
            forecasts in the lead up to heading out.

          <p>
            Saltwater fishing includes everything from saltwater creeks to the reef and out
            to the ocean. There are many ways to go fishing in the saltwater, with the most
            common using bait or flicking lures in remote creeks, trolling offshore for pelagics or reef fishing.

          <h3 class="title">Freshwater Fishing</h3>
          <p>
            Freshwater fishing generally refers to dams or walking up remote creeks and is
            usually done with lures, although bait can be used. Two of the best fighting freshwater fish
            are the mysterious Jungle Perch (JP) and freshwater Barramundi.
